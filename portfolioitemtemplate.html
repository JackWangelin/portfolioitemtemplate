    <h3>This is stuff!</h3>
        <p>In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. We have a fantastic little sky! It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>

        <p>In this world, everything can be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>

        <p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.</p>

        <p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Don't be bashful drop me a line. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?</p>

        <p>Let the paint work. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>

        <p>But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.</p>

        <p>We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.</p>

        <p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? A happy cloud. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. See there how easy that is. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.</p>
